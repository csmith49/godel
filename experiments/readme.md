Each experiment is self-contained. Just navigate to the directory and `make`.

The makefiles don't keep an eye out for changes to `gode.native`, so if that get's modified it's best to clear the data and go again.

## Experiments:

# norm_consistency
A simple check to make sure normalizing with the `system` and `dtree` modules are consistent. There should be no differences---the makefile prints out `wc -l consistency.out`, which is generated by `comm`.

# num_rules
An experiment to determine scalability with number of rules. Still in progress.
